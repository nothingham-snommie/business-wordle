- The board now actually displays letters (you can type with the onscreen keyboard)
- Added gamelogic (still not 100% accurate to the game) along with win and lose conditions
  - The board tiles also shade with ""animation"" to boot!
- Added a valid wordlist (but i don't have a wife to curate it, how sad)
- Added a list of potential answers that also change with each day 
- Made the to-do list

TODO:
- Backpedal on some graphic design so I don't get sued into oblivion (not that it's likely, but better safe than sorry ig)
- Create a well-kept, clean, modular popup system (this is 100% doable i swear)
- Update tile "animation" -> maybe a 1-2 frame fade would work
- Modular theme system, along with dark mode + other topic themes
- Enlargen the valid and answer word lists
- make it work on my phon :)
